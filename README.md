1. Save each of the following networks in the computer memory as an adjacency matrix, and then
write a code to compute the degree of each vertex using the adjacency matrix.

2. The files lesmis.dat and polbooks.dat contain a list of edges for two networks. Write a code which
constructs adjacency matrices using these edge lists as inputs, and then compute the following
for these networks:
(a) Average degre and density
(b) Local clustering coefficients
(c) Degree distribution
(d) Matrix of vertex similarities (Cosine and Katz)

3. Read the adjacency matrix of a directed network from the file celegans.dat, and write a code to
compute the following:
(a) Cocitation and bibliographic coupling matrices
(b) Eigenvector centralities of the vertices
(c) Pagerank centralities of the vertices
